# Supabase Integration

This directory handles the integration with Supabase, which is used as the backend for the application.

## Organization

- **`client.ts`**: This file initializes and exports the Supabase client, which is used to interact with the Supabase services such as the database, authentication, and storage.
- **`types.ts`**: This file contains the TypeScript types for the data stored in the Supabase database. These types are used throughout the application to ensure type safety when working with data from the backend.
