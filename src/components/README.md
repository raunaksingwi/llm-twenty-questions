# Components

This directory houses the reusable React components that form the user interface of the application.

## Organization

The components are organized as follows:

- **`ui/`**: This subdirectory contains general-purpose UI components that are styled with Shadcn UI. These components are the building blocks of the application's design system.
- **Top-level components**: The files directly within this directory are more specific, application-level components that are composed of the smaller UI components from the `ui/` directory. These components encapsulate specific features or sections of the application.
